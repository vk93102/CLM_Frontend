Step 1: Login to the Server
Use the same command as before:

Bash

ssh -i "/Users/vishaljha/Desktop/sk.pem" ubuntu@13.48.148.79
Step 2: Run these Update Commands
Once you are logged in, copy and paste these commands block-by-block.

1. Pull the latest code:

Bash

cd CLM_Backend
git pull
(You might need to type your GitHub username/token if you didn't set up the SSH key, but since you cloned it successfully earlier, this should just work).

2. Update Dependencies & Database (Just in case): If you added new libraries or changed database models, you must run this. If you only changed code, you can skip to Step 3, but running this is safer.

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
3. Restart the App Server (Crucial!) You must do this, or the site will keep showing the old version.

Bash

sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
